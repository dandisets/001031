description: 100 kHz stimulation of hippocampal neurons under different amplitudes
  (measured as one polarity, V; peak-to-peak would be two-fold larger). Sine wave
  amplitude is gradually increased during the initial 0.25 s, then stays constant
  at the voltage indicated in session descriptions. Sine wave stimulation begins at
  25 ms and lasts 2 s. For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into
  36 V/cm. The study was supported in part by NIH 15R21EY034803.
