description: This dataset includes recordings of hippocampal neurons stimulated at
  100 kHz under various amplitudes (measured as one polarity, V; the peak-to-peak
  value would be double this amount). Rectangular bipolar pulses were applied continuously
  for 2 seconds, beginning at 25 ms, with a 50% duty cycle. The pulse amplitude was
  constant at the indicated voltage. For the electrode configuration used, 1V corresponds
  to 36 V/cm. Neuron action potentials were visualized using the voltage-sensitive
  fluorescent dye, FluoVolt. This study was partially supported by NIH grant 15R21EY034803.
